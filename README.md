A Tic Tac Toe component based on the following requirements:

>Build a tic-tac-toe component in React where a human plays a computer. 
Keep a running score computer/human in LocalStorage. 

The Tic Tac Toe game allows a human to play a computer.  The computer utilizes the Minimax algorithm and therefore cannot 
lose.  The computer can only win or draw.

After a new game is started by clicking the "New Game" button, the component randomly determines if the 
human or the computer will start.  If the computer starts, the first "O" will be placed
randomly for the computer.

The Tic Tac Toe score board utilizes the browser localstorage and the changes to the score are
communicated using a custom JavaScript event.

Run the program by running
```
npm install
npm start
```
A webserver will start on localhost on the port 3000 and the web page will
open in the default browser.

Good Luck!  (It won't help)
